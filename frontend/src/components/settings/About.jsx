        <h2>About - OSINT Toolkit v0.1 (beta)</h2>
        <p>
          OSINT Toolkit is a self-hostable, on-demand analysis platform designed
          for security specialists. It consolidates various security tools into
          a single, easy-to-use environment, streamlining everyday investigative
          tasks. Optimized for single-user operation, OSINT Toolkit runs locally
          in a Docker container and is not intended for long-term data storage
          or management. Instead, it focuses on accelerating daily workflows,
          such as news aggregation and analysis, IOC and email investigations,
          and the creation of threat detection rules. To further enhance
          efficiency, OSINT Toolkit integrates generative AI capabilities,
          providing additional support for analysis and decision-making. Beyond
          its practical applications, the project also serves as a personal
          playground for experimenting with new technologies and automation
          possibilities â€” potentially laying the foundation for a future
          commercial cloud platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name OSINT Toolkit is a temporary name. The name may be changed in
          the future.
